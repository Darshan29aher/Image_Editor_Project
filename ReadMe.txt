1. Color Filters
Black and White (Monochrome) Filter: Converts images to shades of gray, emphasizing contrast and tones. Often used in black-and-white photography.
Warm/Cool Filters: Enhance the warmth (yellow/orange) or coolness (blue) of an image. These filters are used to adjust the color temperature.

2. Polarizing Filters
Circular Polarizer (CPL): Reduces reflections from non-metallic surfaces like water and glass, enhances the color of the sky, and increases contrast and saturation.

3. Neutral Density (ND) Filters
Standard ND Filter: Reduces the amount of light entering the camera without affecting color balance, allowing for slower shutter speeds or wider apertures.
Graduated ND Filter: Similar to a standard ND filter but with a gradual transition from dark to clear. Used to balance exposure in scenes with a bright sky and darker foreground.

4. UV and Skylight Filters
UV Filter: Blocks ultraviolet light, reducing haze and protecting the lens.
Skylight Filter: Similar to a UV filter but adds a slight warm tint, useful for outdoor photography.

5. Special Effects Filters
Soft Focus Filter: Adds a dreamy, blurred effect to the image, often used in portrait photography.
Starburst Filter: Creates star-like patterns from light sources, adding a sparkling effect to night photography.
Infrared Filter: Blocks visible light and only allows infrared light, creating unique and surreal images with glowing white foliage and dark skies.

6. Color Correction Filters
Warming/Cooling Filters: Adjust the color balance of the image, often used in film photography to correct for different lighting conditions (e.g., tungsten, daylight).

7. Close-Up Filters
Macro Filter: Allows for closer focusing distances, enabling macro photography without a dedicated macro lens.

8. Graduated Color Filters
Graduated Color Filters: Similar to graduated ND filters but with color instead of neutral density. They are used to add color to a portion of the image, such as enhancing a sunset or sunrise.
Each of these filters serves a specific purpose and can greatly enhance the creative possibilities in photography.
