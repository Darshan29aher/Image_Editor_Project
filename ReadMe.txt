# Image Editor Project

## Overview

This project is an ongoing effort to build a feature-rich Image Editor using Python's Tkinter library and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). The project is in its early stages, and I'm continually adding new features and enhancements.

## Features

- **Open Images**: Load images from your filesystem.
- **Save Images**: Save edited images back to your filesystem.
- **Brush Tool**: Draw on the canvas using a brush tool.
- **Color Picker**: Choose any color to use with the brush tool.

## Future Enhancements

- **Filters**: Add image filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia).
- **Crop and Resize**: Implement cropping and resizing functionalities.
- **More Tools**: Add more drawing tools like a pencil, eraser, and shapes.
- **Advanced Features**: Integrate features like layer management, text annotations, and more.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n image_editor_env --prefix D:\Anaconda\envs\image_editor_env python=3.11
conda activate image_editor_env
pip install pillow
